		<hr>Before furthering my studies to UiTM, I was working as a Flagman in a construction site.<br/> 
		It is well-payed job and I can't help to apply the job even I know that I will work under<br/> 
		the hot sun. Im doing so because I dont want to be burden in my family and I spent the<br/>  
		money to pay the UiTM's registration fee.<hr> 
		LABOR<br/> <hr> During the MCO, I helped my fathers as a laborer. He is a laborer now since he can't stay<br/>  still doing nothing at home since his retirement of Navy Soldier. We will do "on call" job<br/>  such as repairing toilets, doing renovation and more cement-related works.<hr>
		<br/>2.UNIVERSITY EXPERIENCES<hr> 
		FUTSAL TOURNAMENT<hr> 
		I am joining a Futsal tournament which is held in UiTM's Futsal court with my housemate.<br/> 
		We also won the third place in the tournament. There are unexpected things happen in the<br/> 
		Futsal tournament which is our team protested the other team because of one of their<br/> 
		player is not even a UiTM's student.<hr> 
		<br/>3.OTHER EXPERIENCES<hr>
		Football Tournament<hr>	
		I have joined District's football team when I was in Secondary School. We lost the <br/>
		tournament when we reach the first knockout game.<hr>  </h1></font>
