<font size="1"><h1 style="left: 405px; top: 130px;">The Six of Us<hr>
There are a total of 6 family members in my family. This family consist of 4 siblings<br/>
including me where I am the most handsome one. I have a beautiful and caring mother<br/>
who take care of me and my supportive yet strict father. This family is all I have<br/>
eventhough all we do is annoy each other but there is nothing thicker than blood.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

Mother and Father<hr>
This is the picture of my Mother and Father. My mother's name is Suhana binti Hassan.<br/>
She works as a teacher in SK Bendang Nyior, Tanah Merah, Kelantan. She is a beautiful,<br/>
kind, caring and lovely mother. My father's name is Wan Roslan bin Wan Mohd Nawai.<br/>
He is a former Navy Soldier and currently working as a labor. He will go to work when<br/> there are calling from the villagers. He is a handsome, kind, and funny person. I love both<br/> 
of my parents very much.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>

Older Brother<hr>
This is the picture of the first born child in my family. His name is Wan Muhammad Faris Aidil.<br/> 
He is 23 years old and now furthering his study in Bachelor in English with Communication (Honours).<br/> 
He is a funny person but he can be strict sometimes due to his responsibility as the eldest child<br/> 
in the family.
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

Second Child of The Family<hr>
The second child of the family named Wan Muhammad Faisal. He is 22 years old. He is now working<br/> 
in 7 Eleven Tanah Merah. He is the most short-tempered among the siblings. Even he had<br/> 
short-tempered issue, I love to annoy him the most. 
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

The Youngest Child of The Family<hr>
This is my younger brother. His name is Wan Muhammad Farid. He is currently 19 years old.<br/> 
He is the most spoiled child in this family. Even he is my younger brother, I can see he worked<br/> 
hard to earn pocket money. He helps my father works at the village while waiting for the Navy's<br/> 
interview.
